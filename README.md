## Abstract
> Financial fraud is an everyday problem that banking institutions have to face. With the disruption of Bitcoin as a new model which relies on decentralization and anonymity, attackers have taken advantage of this monetary system that allows them to obtain funds from illegal activities such as ransomware payments or terrorist organizations financing. At the same time, Law Enforcement Agencies use the availability of Blockchain data in order to detect suspicious transactions. The problem is that this task is usually performed by artificial intelligence and the current situation shows us a scarcity of high quality data sets. Algorithms do not have enough samples to learn the different patters that are hidden behind illicit Bitcoin transactions. This thesis tries to overcome this problem with significant contributions. We have increased in nearly 25,000 illicit transactions the Elliptic Data Set, which is the largest labelled transaction data set publicly available in any cryptocurrency. The former data set only contained 4,545 illicit transactions, resulting in a class imbalance of 9.8:90.2 illicit/licit ratio. Our work has changed that to a 41.2:58.8 illicit/licit ratio. In order to show that class imbalance can also be beaten with artificial work, we have studied the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for creating synthetic samples. The last part of this thesis was dedicated to the study of long short- term memory networks (LSTM) for the binary classification problem of detecting illicit Bitcoin transactions. The current state of the art is mainly focused on machine learning algorithms and we have showed that deep learning is getting promising results and can be an alternative solution for the future.
